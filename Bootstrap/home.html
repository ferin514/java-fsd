      <b><h2>Experience Different Cultures</h2></b>
      <i><p>The chance to experience different cultures, traditions and customs is one of the most amazing things about travelling. However, you don’t have to spend thousands of pounds flying to a faraway destination to delve into a new culture. The UK, and London especially, is one of the world’s most vibrant multicultural cities, so you can learn about other beliefs and traditions right at home.</p></i>

      <b><h2>Relax and Unwind</h2></b>
      <i><p>It is vital that you relax, and unwind when you are traveling, even if you are only away for a couple of days. Your life is hectic and wider world events can affect you more than you realize. Excess stress, pressure and worry in your life will take its toll on you, and will leave you feeling less than fantastic.</p></i>
